    "Answer:\n",
    "Introduction to Graphs\n",
    "Graphs are data structures used to represent \"connections\" between pairs of elements.\n",
    "•\tThese elements are called nodes. They represent real-life objects, persons, or entities.\n",
    "•\tThe connections between nodes are called edges.\n",
    "This is a graphical representation of a graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are represented with colored circles and edges are represented with lines that connect these circles.\n",
    "Applications\n",
    "Graphs are directly applicable to real-world scenarios. For example, we could use graphs to model a transportation network where nodes would represent facilities that send or receive products and edges would represent roads or paths that connect them (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Network represented with a graph\n",
    "Types of Graphs\n",
    "Graphs can be:\n",
    "•\tUndirected: if for every pair of connected nodes, you can go from one node to the other in both directions.\n",
    "•\tDirected: if for every pair of connected nodes, you can only go from one node to another in a specific direction.\n",
    "    We use arrows instead of simple lines to represent directed edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted Graphs\n",
    "A weight graph is a graph whose edges have a weight or cost. The weight of an edge can represent distance, time, or anything\n",
    "that models the connection between the pair of nodes it connects.\n",
    "For example, in the weighted graph below you can see a blue number next to each edge. This number is used to represent\n",
    "the weight of the corresponding edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose and Use Cases\n",
    "With Dijkstras Algorithm, you can find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Particularly, you can find the shortest \n",
    "path from a node (called the source node) to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.\n",
    "This algorithm is used in GPS devices to find the shortest path between the current location and the destination. \n",
    "It has broad applications in industry, specially in domains that require modeling networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basics of Dijkstras Algorithm\n",
    "•\tDijkstras Algorithm basically starts at the node that you choose (the source node) and it analyzes the graph to find \n",
    "the shortest path between that node and all the other nodes in the graph.\n",
    "•\tThe algorithm keeps track of the currently known shortest distance from each node to the source node and it updates \n",
    "these values if it finds a shorter path.\n",
    "•\tOnce the algorithm has found the shortest path between the source node and another node, that node is marked as \n",
    "visited and added to the path.\n",
    "•\tThe process continues until all the nodes in the graph have been added to the path. This way, we have a path that \n",

    "•\t\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "Dijkstras Algorithm can only work with graphs that have positive weights. This is because, during the process, the weights \n",
    "of the edges have to be added to find the shortest path.\n",
    "If there is a negative weight in the graph, then the algorithm will not work properly. Once a node has been marked as visited,\n",
    "the current path to that node is marked as the shortest path to reach that node. And negative weights can alter this if\n",

    "    Many algorithms solve the shortest path problem. Dijkstra’s algorithm is one form of the greedy algorithm. This algorithm includes a graph search algorithm used to solve the shortest path problem with a single source on a graph that does not have a negative side cost and produces the shortest pathtree. This algorithm is often used in routing . A heuristic is a method designed for solving a problem more quickly. This is achieved by trading accuracy, optimality, completeness, or precision for speed.A* algorithm is an algorithm that finds a path in a graph from a given initial node to a given goal node.It employs a \"heuristic estimate\" h(x) that gives an estimate of the best route that goes through that node. It visits the nodes in order of this heuristic estimate . This paper will compare Dijkstra’s algorithm and A* algorithm to solve the shortest path problem. There are four stages in mathematical modelling: problem identification, constructing a mathematical model, determining mathematical solution from the model, and interpreting mathematical solution into real problem points of view . \n",
    "In Dijkstras algorithm, we calculate the weight of the adjacent nodes and then visit the node that has the least weight. This process is continued until the goal node is reached. Djikstra`s algorithm becomes very similar to the Grassfire Algorithm in case of grids where the weight of each iteration is equal to 1. In such cases, we end up visiting all the nodes until the goal node is reached. This makes it very difficult to use it on larger grids because we visit  all the unnecessary nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra’s Algorithm steps:\n",
    "1. Set all points distance to infinity except for the starting point set distance to 0.\n",
    "2. Set all points, including starting point as a non-visited node.\n",
    "3. Set the non-visited node with the smallest current distance as the current node C.\n",

    "5. Mark the current node C as visited.\n",
    "6. Repeat the step above from step 3 until the destination point is visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the A* algorithm uses the concept of a Heuristic function. In this algorithm, we visit only the nodes that can be on the shortest path by finding the distance of the adjacent nodes to the goal node and choosing the node that is the closest. A* algorithm is just like Dijkstra’s algorithm, and the only difference is that A* tries to look for abetter path by using a heuristic function, which gives priority to nodes that are supposed to be better than others while Dijkstra's just explore all possible ways.\n",
